AK-74M

The AK-74M was dubbed a “Modernized” version of the AK-74 platform developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the early 1990’s. This modern version of the AK-74 was conceived in preparation to the turn of the century, promoting innovation to Kalashnikov’s iconic design. Sporting a 5.45x39mm cartridge, the AK-74M lacks the stopping power provided by its brothers in the AKM family, but has a higher rate of fire and supports assorted close quarters attachments. The AK-74M is a good backup for any survivor, but may take that extra bullet to put your target down.

The AK-74M can be found at medium tier military spawns.

Winchester 1886 Short

WIP by Neil Peart

Based in the lever-action design seen in the Winchester 1866, the Winchester 1886 continued the trend of chambering heavier rounds and featured an all-new and stronger locking-block action than the toggle-link model 1876. This particular rifle was designed by John Moses Browning (becoming most known for his Browning 1911), who had a long and profitable relationship with Winchester.

Chambered in the powerful .45-70 Government cartridge, this was yet the largest caliber chambered in a Winchester repeating rifle.

The Remington Model 700 is the civilian base model for many bolt-action military snipers including the M24 and M40 variants. One of the more common and popular hunting rifles among civilians, the Remington Model 700 does not share the same level of accuracy as its military counterparts but is still an effective rifle in the right hands. The additional 7.62x51mm variants can be used to enhance the rifle's performance and the powerful scopes are also useful for scouting.

BAR

The M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle is a early 20th century machine rifle chambered in 30-06 Springfield that was used primarily by the United States during both World Wars and as recent as the Vietnam War. Designed by master gun maker John Browning in 1917, the BAR sported a high versatility as both an automatic rifle and light machine gun, boasting a high fire rate for the time and a high stopping power. Though heavy, the BAR was assigned to advanced infantry units and held its own in open combat as well as trench warfare for many years of service. The ability to send so much heavy hitting firepower downrange makes the BAR a great choice for medium range engagements against multiple targets.

The BAR can be found in High Tier Vintage Spawns.

FN SCAR H

The SCAR-H is a 7.62x51mm battle rifle that entered service in 2009. Being also called the Mk 17 Mod 0, it was developed simultaneously with its 5.56x45mm NATO counterpart the Mk 16 Mod 0, which did not get approval of the US military. In contrast to that the SCAR-H was sucessfull in replacing the legendary M14 DMR and the SR 25 as sniper systems. The variety of optics that can be mounted and its outstanding accuracy compared to other Battle rifles make it a decent everyday rifle.

FN FAL

The Fusil Automatique Léger ("Light Automatic Rifle") or FAL is a semi-automatic, selective fire battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.

The FAL was predominantly chambered for the 7.62x51mm round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many NATO countries during the Cold War it was nicknamed "The right arm of the Free World". The FN FAL does not support attachments but its Iron Sights are accurate to 700-800m

The FN FAL can be found at High Tier Military and Dynamic High Tier Spawns.

Mk12 Mod 1 SpecOps

The Mk12 Mod 1 SpecOps is a heavily modified M16 designed to fill the Designated Marksman role. The Mk12 Mod 1 SpecOps utilizes a special variant of the 5.56x45mm to extend its range and power beyond the stock 5.56x45mm NATO round. While the Mk12 Mod 1 SpecOps does not possess the stopping power of its higher caliber brothers, its light recoil, accuracy and very high bullet velocity make it ideal for precision take-downs via headshot or multiple successive center mass shots. The attached rail covers help further increase accuracy by dampening recoil on the support hand and the OPS INC 5.56 Suppressor allows for very quiet operation. Extreme accuracy combined with quiet operation make this rifle the perfect choice for precision assassinations.

Its compact design makes it the lightest of all the LMGs and it features the same optic support as the other MX rifles.

The MX-SW can only be found at Dynamic High Tier Spawns and is the best all around LMG thanks to its decent power, lightweight and attachment versatility.

M249 SAW

The American version of the Belgian FN MINIMI, the M249 SAW fires 5.56x45mm NATO rounds from a 200 round box giving it the largest capacity of any personnel weapon in the game. Compatible with a wide range of optics for additional flexibility, the M249 SAW is an extremely versatile light machine gun. The M249 SAW's ammo capacity, light 5.56 recoil and range of attachments make it suitable for anything from close quarters combat to engagements requiring high amounts of suppressive fire.

The M249 SAW can be found at High Tier Military and Dynamic High Tier Spawns.

Smith & Wesson .45

The Smith & Wesson .45 is a shorter version of the larger 500 Nitro, repurposed to accommodate a .45 6 Round Various Colt cartridge for more practical purposes than that offered by its big brother. Though smaller in both size and caliber, the S&W .45 is a force to be reckoned with, boasting a medium amount of damage in a very controllable pistol, and not to mention ammunition is easier to come by in one's travels. The S&W .45 is a good all-purpose revolver for any survivor, but it wouldn’t hurt to upgrade if given the chance.

The S&W .45 can be found in Civilian and Construction Spawns.

Smith & Wesson 500

The Smith & Wesson 500 Nitro Mag is a true hand cannon, and is considered the largest production handgun available to consumers. Chambered in 50 caliber 12.7x41mmSR, this revolver has seen use in recreational shooting and hunting, with little to no practical use for carry or military service. Capable of being equipped with a scope, and coupled with the enormous stopping power, this is a good choice for a skilled marksman up to medium ranges.

The S&W 500 can be found at Construction Spawns.

Micro Uzi

The Micro-Uzi is a scaled down version of the Uzi, introduced in 1986. The Micro-Uzi is a compact Fully Automatic Machine Pistol capable of firing the 9mm round. With a range of Ammunition types and magazine capacities from 15/19/33 Rounds, to the integral ACO Pistol Sight and the ability to take 9mm Suppressors and Flashlights, this Machine Pistol is fully suitable for urban combat environments whether searching for loot in towns or in close quarter searching of military sites.

This is my favourite Pistol, with the ability to make easy head shots on Zombies with inbuilt ACO Sight and the ability to switch to full automatic fire when you are swarmed by Zombies combined with the high rate of fire and the capability to take the largest capacity 9mm magazine, it is my opinion the best weapon for silent takedowns of Zombies while looting.

The Micro Uzi can be found at High Tier Military Spawns.

Ammunition

Having a gun in Breaking Point is essential to your continued survival. Without a gun you are at the mercy of the Zombies, the environment and other survivors.

But, having a gun by itself does preclude your survival, you also need the right ammunition for your weapon. Without the right ammunition or not enough ammunition that sudden gunfight can be over for you very quickly and then it’s a long walk back from the coast.

Pistol Ammunition

There is a range of Pistol calibers, magazine sizes, and different types of ammunition available in Breaking Point.

From your standard 9mm Round to the powerful and player stopping .500 magnum round you will find all the information you require here, just remember having ammunition is good, having a gun that can use the ammunition is even better.
-9mm-

The world's most common pistol round, standard issue among law enforcement and Military alike. Readily available in a number of variants and effective within 50m, although it is possible to make lethal shots beyond this range. The 9x19mm however does not quite pack the same punch as the equally popular .45ACP but its smaller cartridge allows for larger magazine sizes.


    9x18mm Makarov - Russian round for use in the Makarov pistol. It has less recoil than the typical 9x19mm Parabellum but is also less effective against human targets.
    9x19mm Parabellum - Standard full metal jacket ball rounds capable of moderate damage and minor hydrostatic shock effects.
    9x19mm +P+ - Loaded to a much higher pressure than standard 9x19mm, +P+ rounds have higher muzzle velocity, increased effective range and improved ballistics which increase damage and hydrostatic shock effects.

-.45ACP-

A very effective cartridge against human targets, the .45ACP has long been considered superior to the 9x19mm in regards to stopping power at the expense of higher recoil and lower magazine capacity. Most .45ACP loads are subsonic so special ammo is not needed when combining with a suppressor to achieve optimum results. A number of variants exist that build on the .45ACP's already impressive stopping power.


    .45 ACP - Standard full metal jacket ball round capable of moderate to high damage and hydrostatic shock effects.
    .45JHP+ - High velocity Jacketed Hollow Point rounds designed to cause maximum soft tissue damage. Highly effective against human targets.

    .45 TranQ - Tranquilizer rounds designed to incapacitate human targets for a short time.

-Magnum Rounds-

From the .357 Magnum cartridge which was the one that started "Magnum" era of handgun ammunition, to the largest production handgun caliber available, the .500 Nitro Magnum. The Magnum Round is a very popular self defense round known for its excellent stopping power and its cult following.


"I know what you’re thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I’ve kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you’ve got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?" - Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan

Shotgun Ammunition

A shotgun shell or shotshell is a self-contained cartridge loaded with lead shot or a shotgun slug which is designed to be fired from a shotgun.

Most shotgun shells are designed to be fired from a smoothbore barrel, but dedicated shotguns with rifled barrels may take a number of different rounds. A rifled barrel will increase the accuracy of slugs, but makes it unsuitable for firing shot, as it imparts a spin to the shot cup, causing a centrifugal force that makes the shot form a hollow "O" shape in flight.

Crossbow bolts
Arrow.png

Currently there are four types of crossbow bolts in game

    Borehead – Standard Bolts: Deals a large amount of damage to the target.
    Poison – Causes infection: When hit with the bolt, the target will die within 2 minutes.
    Tranq – tranquilizer Bolts: When hit with the bolt, the target will pass out for a short period of time, similar to the effects of the TranQ Pistol.
    Rambo – Explosive Tip: Upon impacting any surface, the bolt will produce an explosion similar to a Fragmentation Grenade.
    Fire – Sets fire to the target.

Crossbow and bolts
-.22 Long Rifle-

A cartridge developed primarily for small game hunting, what it lacks in stopping power it makes up for by being extremely quiet and very easy to suppress. Headshots will still bring down a human target in one hit and recoil is practically nonexistent. The most common ammunition in the game.

    .22 Long Rifle - Standard copper plated high velocity rounds capable of light damage and wounding/hydrostatic shock effects.

-.223 Remington-

The .223 Remington is the parent cartridge of the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, and shares similar properties. With the advent of the AR-15 platform, the .223 Remington cartridge saw increased popularity with sports and hunting shooters and has seen widespread adoption as a varminting round. Due to small differences in dimensions and loading, the .223 Remington variants can be safely and effectively fired from rifles chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO Various but not the other way around.

    .223 Remington - Standard jacketed varmint round capable of moderate damage but low wounding and hydrostatic shock effects.
    .22-250 - A specialised .223 cartridge that began life as a wildcat cartridge, with a .250 Savage case necked down to accept a .224 calibre round., yielding higher muzzle velocities of over 1,100 m/second. The .22-250 was adopted by the Australian Special Air Service for use in urban counter-terrorism operations in an effort to reduced possible collateral damage from over-penetration and ricochets.
    .223 BTHP - The .223 Boat-Tail Hollow-Point round features both a more aerodynamic tapered "boat tail" shape for flatter bullet trajectory and a jacketed hollow tip for superior wounding properties.

-30.06 Springfield-

One of the most popular rifle rounds ever produced, the 30-06 Springfield is still widely used today over a century after its standardization. Standard loads have a slight edge over the stock 7.62x51mm NATO rounds and custom loads can reach .300 Winchester Magnum power levels. The standard 30-06 does not hold its power at range as well as the 7.62x51mm NATO round due to inferior aerodynamics.

The .300 Winchester Magnum is devastating against human sized targets and is extremely accurate well beyond 1km. Precision ammunition is available for when the utmost in accuracy and power is required.

The 7.92×57mm Mauser (designated as the 8mm Mauser or 8×57mm by the SAAMI [2] and 8 × 57 IS by the C.I.P. is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. The 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge was adopted by the German Empire in 1905, and was the German service cartridge in both World Wars. In its day, the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge was one of the world’s most popular military cartridges. In the 21st century it is still a popular sport and hunting cartridge that is factory-produced in Europe and the United States.

-5.45mm Russian-

Russian standard issue cartridge for the smaller caliber AK rifles. The 5.45x39mm is similar in performance to the American 5.56x45mm NATO in many ways but differs substantially in soft target performance. The 5.45x39mm round is very unstable and tumbles very quickly when entering soft targets creating much larger, unpredictable wound channels.

-5.56mm Nato-

Standard issue rifle cartridge for all NATO forces, the 5.56x45mm has faced some criticism since its adoption in the early 1960's. High velocity and low recoil make it very usable but the round does not fragment or yaw reliably within the target and therefore does not create particularly serious wounds. Improved versions of the round have been fielded to address this issue.

    5.56x45mm NATO - Standard full metal jacket ball round capable of moderate damage but low wounding and hydrostatic shock effects.
    5.56x45mm Mk262 Mod 1 - A specialized 5.56x45mm round designed for use in the Designated Marksman role and standard in the Mk12 Mod 1. Similar benefits as the M855A1 in regards to soft target performance with greater effective range but decreased hard target penetration.
    5.56x45mm M855A1-EPR - An improved 5.56x45mm round with more consistent performance against human targets. Moderate/high damage and wounding/hydrostatic shock effects.
    5.56x45mm Subsonic - Subsonic variant of the standard 5.56x45mm round.
