Planned for Android 4.0.3 IceCreamSandwich and above (nearly 100 % of all Android users)


Planned content:

- singleplayer (maybe multiplayer very late in development)
- Chernarus map high resolution, accessable anytime during play
- player must find his own position everytime and can place markers  on map)
- 1920x1080 ingame screenshots of all buildings (Chernarus Redux ArmA 3 mod)
- screenshots of buildings at 3 different daytimes and rain and no rain:

  - afternoon
  - early evening
  - late evening/early morning (to be decided if sun position is important)

so basically 6 screenshots of a building at least, targeted amount is 12 or even 18 per building (so we have screenshots from 2-3 positions around/in/on a building)

- original sounds (rain, no rain, wind)
- hunger, thirst, sickness, bleeding (RNG for chance for finding food, water)
- RNG based events (depending on location on map)

- statistics website showing:
   - player nickname
   - player deaths (in total)
   - survived days
   - killed zombies, distance travelled

- simulated Zombies chasing the player (player must react in time to avoid or shoot at zombie)
- for weapon aiming, player must tap a button on the screen at the right timing to land a shot (maybe even RNG for hit probability)

Estimated App size:

- 50-100 MB for the base app with only basic images 

- 500-1000 MB for full 1080p version (possibly allowing downloading the images from a server while the game is already running, with menu to see current estimated full download time, calculated from server load)

- 250-500 MB for a possible later 720p version (mostly containing downsized 1280x720 screenshots, as a 720p image is less than half the size of a 1080p image)
