# BP text-based android game

Planned for Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and above (99.3 % of all Android users)


Planned content:

- Chernarus map high resolution, accessable anytime during play
- player must find his own position everytime and can place markers  on map)
- 1920x1080 ingame screenshots of all buildings (Chernarus Redux ArmA 3 mod)
- screenshots of buildings at 3 different daytimes and rain and no rain:

  - afternoon
  - early evening
  - late evening/early morning (to be decided if sun position is important)

so basically 6 screenshots of a building at least, targeted amount is 12 or even 18 per building (so we have screenshots from 2-3 positions around/in/on a building)

- original sounds (rain, no rain, wind)
- hunger, thirst, sickness, bleeding
- RNG based events (depending on location on map)
- simulated Zombies chasing the player (player must react in time to avoid or shoot at zombie)
- for weapon aiming, player must tap a button on the screen at the right timing to land a shot (maybe even RNG for hit probability)

Estimated App size 250-500 MB,


possibly a small version only containing downsized 1280x720 screenshots.
